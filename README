# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. The solutions are implemented mostly in Haskell, with Python scripts to help with IO.

## Structure

The repository is organized using subfolders for each day:

- `day01/`
- `day02/`
- `day03/`
- ...

Each subfolder contains the Haskell and Python source for that day's solutions, as well as my input files for that day's challenge.
